# SteamApiAccessor
Purpose of this package is to enable working with the public steam API through the requests package.

When steam_api.steam_api_controller is provided with an API key and a profile it can run a number of queries and returned a slightly cleaned response.

Owned_game_controller provides several methods to manipulate the response of the get_profile_games request.
